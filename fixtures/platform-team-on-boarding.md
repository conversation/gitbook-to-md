## Security & Privacy

Very much WIP draft staus

Security and Privacy are core tenets which should be accounted for when designing and implementing software for The Conversation.

- User privacy is paramount. We strive to make a secure and resilient platform and thus should question decisions orthogonal to that tenet.
- Every member's laptop should have disk level encryption enabled. For Apple OSX users [please follow these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204837).

## Content Persistence

Content persistence is a fundamental part of our identity at The Conversation.
By reading the editorial [content removal policy](https://theconversation.com/au/content-removal-policy) you will get an understanding of how the editorial team make decisions on content removal.
Only even in extreme circumstances will we ever _kill_ a piece of content.

This has some interesting challenges when designing, building and deploying our software. Namely: $$E = m * c^{2}$$
